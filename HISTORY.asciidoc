Relase History
==============

v0.0.8 -- March 15, 2015
------------------------
Performance Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Self tail calls are now implemented with while loops rather than lambda/redo.
* Lists containing only constants are created once and cached.
* `Klam::Absvector` contains an `Array` instance rather than inheriting from
  `Array`

v0.0.7 -- February 24, 2015
---------------------------
New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Debugging output enabled by global flags:
** `*dump-kl*` causes the KLambda code received by the compiler to be dumped
   to stdout.
** `*dump-rb*` causes the Ruby code generated by the compiler to be dumped
   to stdout.
** `*include-backtrace-in-error-string*` causes the backtrace from the error
   object to be appended to the string returned by error-to-string.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Carriage return and new line are now properly escaped in emitted Ruby code. This
  fixes "warning: encountered \r in middle of line, treated as a mere space" messages
  that show up, e.g., when using a unit string like "c#13;" in Shen.
